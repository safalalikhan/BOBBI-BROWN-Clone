# Bobbi-brown-clone
We had to make the clone of Bobbi Brown India the premium cosmetics brand. We have tried to make it as perfect of a clone as possible, adding most of the features and making it look similar to the website. The one big issue we faced was getting the data, we were not able to find any API, so we had to hard code the data. We have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with local storage. We hadnâ€™t used any frameworks for the project.

  The most challenging as well as the most important part of the project. The navbar links all the pages together and has links to login, signup, and cart as well.
